# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, in contrary with natural intelligence which is how people think and solve problems, is the intelligence demonstrated by machines.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of algorithms and statistical models that various computer systems use in order to perform a task without any implicit instructions.

## Search Algorithms

Given a problem with a state space, a search algorithm's purpose is to find the solution. All algorithms that try to find a solution are called search algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Most of the examples contain an algorithm commonly used in machine learning, called gradient descent. If you wish to understand how gradient descent works and run some examples on your own machine, navigating to the gradient-descent folder or click on the following link:

* [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/sotostzam/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/gradient-descent)

## How to run code

In order to run the examples you need to have the following requirements:

1) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
3) [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

For your convenience there is a file named requirements, which holds the information about all the required libraries. After making sure you have python up and running in your machine, you can install all the requirements by using the following command:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Perceptron Neural Network

This is a Python implementation of a single layer Perceptron. A perceptron is an artificial neuron, which can only solve linearly separable problems.

A perceptron owns the following properties:

* Feed-forward neural network with a single layer
* Used for supervised learning
* Represents a binary classifier, type of linear classifier
* Deals with the training of weights

With this implementation you can interact in real time with the perceptron. More specifically you can:

1. See current weights of the perceptron

2. Train the Perceptron with a given dataset

3. Give a test value to the perceptron and get a guess

## Prerequistes

1) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

For your convenience there is a file named requirements, which holds the information about all the required libraries. After making sure you have python up and running in your machine, you can install all the requirements by using the following command:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

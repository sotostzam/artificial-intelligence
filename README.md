# Perceptron Neural Network

This is a Python implementation of a single layer Perceptron. A perceptron is an artificial neuron, which can only solve linearly separable problems.

* Feed-forward neural network with a single layer
* Used for supervised learning
* Represents a binary classifier, type of linear classifier
* Deals with the training of weights

## Prerequistes

1) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

For your convenience there is a file named requirements, which holds the information about all the required libraries. After making sure you have python up and running in your machine, you can install all the requirements by using the following command:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

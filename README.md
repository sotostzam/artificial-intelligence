# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, in contrary with natural intelligence which is how people think and solve problems, is the intelligence demonstrated by machines.

## Problem Solving

The ability to solve problems that arise, is a fundamental part of artificial intelligence. In other words, the ability any model has to demonstrate some form of intelligence is an important property to own. For instance, given a maze with some random obstacles, an intelligent model of any nature, should be able to recognize and avoid the obstacles while finding its way to its destination.

For the automation of this procedure, there are search algorithms, which given a brief understanding of the problem state, they search for a solution.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of algorithms and statistical models that various computer systems use in order to perform a task without any implicit instructions.

## Prerequisites

Most of the examples contain an algorithm commonly used in machine learning, called gradient descent. If you wish to understand how gradient descent works and run some examples on your own machine, navigating to the gradient-descent folder or click on the following link:

* [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/sotostzam/artificial-intelligence/tree/master/gradient-descent)

## How to run code

In order to run the examples you need to have the following requirements:

1) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
3) [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

For your convenience there is a file named requirements, which holds the information about all the required libraries. After making sure you have python up and running in your machine, you can install all the requirements by using the following command:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Machine Learning

## What is machine learning

* "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." -- Arthur Samuels (1959).

This repository contains work and examples i have done to showcase the use of each respective algorithm used in machine learning and artificial intelligence in general.

## Prerequisites

Most of the examples contain an algorithm commonly used in machine learning, called gradient descent. If you wish to understand how gradient descent works and run some examples on your own machine, i am including a link to my other repository going over gradient descent in detail.

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

* [Perceptron](https://github.com/sotostzam/artificial-neural-networks/tree/master/perceptron)
* [Multilayer Perceptron](https://github.com/sotostzam/artificial-neural-networks/tree/master/multilayer-perceptron)

## How to run code

In order to run the examples you need to have the following requirements:

1) [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
3) [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

For your convenience there is a file named requirements, which holds the information about all the required libraries. After making sure you have python up and running in your machine, you can install all the requirements by using the following command:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

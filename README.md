# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, in contrary with natural intelligence which is how people think and solve problems, is the intelligence demonstrated by machines.

## Problem Solving

The ability to solve problems that arise, is a fundamental part of artificial intelligence. In other words, the ability any model has to demonstrate some form of intelligence is an important property to own. For instance, given a maze with some random obstacles, an intelligent model of any nature, should be able to recognize and avoid the obstacles while finding its way to its destination.

For the automation of this procedure, there are search algorithms, which given a brief understanding of the problem state, they search for a solution.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of algorithms and statistical models that various computer systems use in order to perform a task without any implicit instructions.

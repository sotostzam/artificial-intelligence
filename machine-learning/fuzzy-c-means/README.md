# Fuzzy c-means Clustering

## Information

Fuzzy clustering (also referred to as soft clustering or soft k-means) is a form of clustering in which each data point can belong to more than one cluster. The FCM algorithm attempts to partition a finite collection of n elements into a collection of c fuzzy clusters with respect to some given criterion. Therefore the fuzzy c-means identifies clusters as fuzzy sets by learning the membership matrix U and C the set of K centroids minimizing the clustering loss.

## Distance measurement

Distance is measured using the Euclidean distance. This is the straight-line distance between two points.

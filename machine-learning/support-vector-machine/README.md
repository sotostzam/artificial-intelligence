# Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines are models used in supervised learning that analyze data used both for classification and regression analysis. Feeding it some training dataset, and the correct targets, the support vector machine (svm) can identify and predict new data.

With this python implementation, the user can see the decision boundary (indicated as a dotted line) and the support vector hyperplanes (indicated by black lines). After this a training dataset is fed into the svm, and it shows its prediction on the visualization, using star markers indicating the training data.

# K-Nearest Neighbors

## Information

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a tecknique used for regression and classification. In both occurences the input consists of k closest values in the training datasets. If k equals 1, then the classified class is simply the same as the closest training value.

## Distance measurement

As far as this implementation of the k-NN algorithm is concerned, the distance is measured using the Euclidean distance. This is the straight-line distance between two points.

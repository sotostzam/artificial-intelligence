# Machine Learning

## Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are tools widely used in machine learning. They are brain inspired algorithms which replicate the way human beings think and learn. They consist of layers which are called input, hidden and output layers respectively. Deep neural networks usually include a lot of hidden layers (more than one) to produce far more reliable results and improve the learning process.

This repository contains work and examples i have done to showcase the use of each model used in machine learning and artificial intelligence in general.

### Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning that makes use of software agents, which take actions in a given environment. Their goal is to maximize a cumulative reward.

# Problem Solving

Given a problem and a description of its state space, we want to find a solution. To achieve that, we have to apply a sequence of strictly predetermined steps, also known as algorithms. All algorithms that fall into that category, meaning they try to find a solution to a problem, are called search algorithms.
